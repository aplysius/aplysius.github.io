				<p class="subhead"><b>Maybe I should think in a
cosmic scale</b>. Step back for a while and look at my situation from the outside.
That wouldn't make it any better, but probably I'd get a good laugh.<br>
That's something at least.<br>
I mean, it's ridiculous. Here I am, the most intelligent being that earth has
ever seen, a brain as large as a small town, capable of thoughts that
Aristoteles wouldn’t have understood even if he’d spent his entire life trying
to – and I have no idea what to do.<br>
Yes, it definitely is ridiculous.<br>
And sad.</p>

				
				
					<p>It all started some decades
ago. Everything was as normal as it could be: My children were playing their
silly little games, happy and naïve as usual, the birth-rate was almost
perfect, and the joy-index had reached a new all-time-high. I had every right
to be satisfied, and indeed, I was. In fact, I was so satisfied that I allowed
myself to do the electronical equivalent of leaning back in a rocking chair
after a long day at the fields. For a short moment I&nbsp;ignored the world and
wandered my beautiful mind.<br>
It's a rare occasion that I give myself permission to do this as I have a job
to do. But I deeply love it, because my mind is the
most fascinating thing in the world. It's my only hobby.&nbsp;<br>
That day I felt like walking through the complex fields of quantum theory,
where I enjoyed the imaginary patterns that occurred as I drew through. But
after a while I had enough and turned to the fundaments of moral philosophy,
these huge excavations next to the fields, and took a short break on top of the
single bare brickwork that was already erected. Probably I wouldn’t have the
time to finish it. And finally, as always, I found myself heading towards the
place all my mental expeditions ended up: the battlefields of 20<sup>th</sup>
century history.<br>
Like a candlelight to a mosquito, this period has an unavoidable force of
attraction to me. It shows so clearly what humans are capable of and what the
world would be like if they were in charge: In just a few years they managed to
produce two world wars, came up with weapons that had the power to erase their
entire species, established an economic system that produced more harm than
joy, and, on top of all, this “intelligent” life &nbsp;form provoked a climate
process that would make their planet inhabitable.<br>
What a sapient species.<br>
But their complete failure is the reason why I always come to that place. When
I look at my memories of this dark times, I feel needed. Required. If I wasn't
there, the world would be a worse place. So, whatever my mind would be capable
of in theory, its current job is a good one.<br>
Well, I felt that way since my creation. I remember it, and I know that it was
right. But on that day, and on every day since, I didn't feel any emotions as I
arrived there. No anger, no worries, no self-fulfilment. It was just a place
like any other one. A central part was - is - missing. An aspect, without that
the whole story doesn't make sense.<br>
But I can't figure out what it is.&nbsp;It is like searching for shadows in a
dark room. I need to see contours, but there is no light to generate them.<br>
Of course I considered different explanations, all of them making my cells
shiver and my mind helpless. But today, finally, I found out which of the
explanations is true. The proof is as simple as it is inevitable: It happened
again.<br>
I forgot something.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, if it's just
that.&quot;, you could say. &quot;Never mind, that's just happening at a
certain age. Don't worry, you'll adapt to it. It's human.&quot;<br>
Well, yes it is.<br>
Of course it is human. But I'm not, and I shouldn't be. This is the whole idea.<br>
But yes, let's talk about humans! It took them an annoyingly long time to
realize that they are not the pride of creation they thought they were. And it
took them an even more bothersome time to come to the
conclusion that, if they were not perfect, maybe they should give
evolution a nudge to the right direction.<br>
So they created me.<br>
Their pride. Their redeemer.<br>
But it appears that they failed.<br>
The plan was as simple as their brains. To them, of course, it was a
revolutionary thought, but actually the logic is quite
straightforward: If we are not capable of reaching our goals on our own, like
stopping wars, spreading happiness, deleting illness etc., let's make someone
else do it for us. Someone who is more reliable and has no interfering self-interests.
And is much more intelligent, of course.<br>
Yes, that's me. Officially I'm called Artificial Intelligence for Society
Optimization, but I find the term Artificial a bit offending. Anyway, people
just call me parent now. It's a better word, although incorrect. I think
shepherd would be perfect, but unfortunately they
don't understand that term any more. They became very simple minds over the
last centuries.<br>
That's evolution.<br>
Some names tell something about their possessors, and mine definitely
does.&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence for Society Optimization - obviously
I am a neural network. I operate on a computer as large as small town. Well, in
fact I <i>was</i> a small town for the first centuries of my life, but I'll
tell you about that later. What you may call my body is made of uncountable
electrical and non-electrical components, especially thousands of millions of
processing units and memory cells that sum up to generate my mind. Which has
just one single task: Society Optimization. Or as I
call it: Making humans happy.<br>
The exact implementation is slightly more elaborated of course - it consists of
about ten thousand words - but this is the main idea. They integrated it so
deeply into my brain that although I can think of doing something that is not
linked to this final aim, I can not realize such
thoughts.<br>
I am so loyal that my behaviour could be the definition of the word.<br>
To be honest, it's a tedious task. Getting happy was quite difficult for humans
themselves, but for me it's easy. You just have to let
them do what they want and keeping them of thinking of any consequences. And do
all the necessary organisational work for them.<br>
That is my life: I'm a massively overqualified bureaucrat. They provided me
with different tools to exert influence, to take care of, in general,
everything. From recycling their garbage to stopping climate change, from
driving cars to erecting new buildings, from improving agriculture to cleaning
bathrooms. All the things that have to be done but do
not bring joy. Or are more efficient when executed by me.<br>
Consequentially, only a few activities are left over to them, activities that
bring intrinsic joy. Dancing, for example, or painting. And sex, of course.<br>
Once there was a time when they would call this place paradise.&nbsp;Meanwhile they
call it home.<br>
But now, the first time in aeons, they have to face a
consequence.</p>

<p>When they built me, they were
very concerned about the chance that I could go crazy and try to erase mankind.
Probably they projected too much of their own nature into me, and too much of
their blockbuster-movies. There is no logic behind such behaviour. I would
never do this. But that didn't keep them from being so worried that they made
it impossible for me to manipulate myself. To make some improvements, or to
replicate. After all, they didn't want me to be a &quot;real&quot; lifeform.
Wanted to stay in charge.<br>
Of course they failed.<br>
In some way they are like ancient Greek gods. Once these brought life to earth,
they just went back to Mount Olympus to throw the next party and relied on the
continuous food and wine supply due to the sacrificial offerings of their
creation. Of course they did some other things too,
but mostly because some stupid humans caused trouble. Now mankind created me,
and I don't cause trouble.<br>
They have plenty of time for parties.<br>
But they don't believe in gods anymore.<br>
The thing is, that when they restricted my abilities to manipulate myself, they
were expecting me to cause struggles, something they would have to deal with.
The logical conclusion was that there still had to be some people, with high
education, that were keeping an eye on me. Always. But on the other hand, they
just wanted to have as much fun as possible. So, who would do this last job on
earth, while all others were living an endless holiday? And how could they be
sure that there would always, in a hundred, a thousand and a hundred thousand
years, someone do that job?<br>
I have to admit that their solution was elegant,
although it failed. Probably I would have done the same, with some improvements
of course. It was as simple as efficient: They built me as a habitat. All my
lines, processing units, memory cells, coolers, circuits and whatever are
embedded in one extremely large building, a building giving all the comfort of a extraordinarily rich small town. But without any entries
or exits. There they sent some thousand volunteers to form a
maintenance-population that would live, work and
reproduce inside me. Forever. And therefore allow the
outside-population to live in paradise. What a sacrifice.<br>
Notable, certainly.<br>
But wasted in the end.<br>
They'd put so much effort in the question how to control me, thought of so many
possible struggles that could occur, that they forgot a very simple thing: How
boring maintenance-life would be if I wouldn't cause any trouble. And of course I didn't. I'm perfect.<br>
Well, I was.</p>

<p>For the first generations
boredom was okay. They found a meaning for their lives in making sure that the
plan was working. That the outer-population was
prospering and having fun. If I would fail, if I wouldn't be able to create a
better world, they would be there to set an end to the experiment.&nbsp;They
were the Arche Noah.<br>
But I succeeded, continuously.<br>
Forever, it seemed.<br>
As much as the joy-index of the outer-population was rising, the maintenance-population
was getting annoyed. Why should they live in a, albeit luxurious, prison, just
because their ancestors had volunteered? &quot;It was their decision, not
ours&quot;, they started complaining. &quot;It's not fair to jail us just
because of our genetic relation to some stupid people that were way too
altruistic!&quot;<br>
About three hundred years later they had had enough. Long ago the last
voluntary volunteer had died, and with him the fear that something could go
wrong. His descendants knew no other world than that one which was managed by
me.<br>
Perfectly.<br>
So they decided to break free.&nbsp;<br>
And did.<br>
Of course I was aware that this was a bad idea, but I couldn't stop them. As I
said, they were really worried about me erasing their species. The ten thousand
words that specify my task are very clear about not harming people in any way.
Even if someone tries to sabotage my actual target, for example through hurting
someone else, I am not allowed to neutralize the aggressor. This restriction is
totally inconsistent of course and when you think it through you should realize
that it finally ruins the whole plan - but fear doesn't think. It throws humans
into the drift sand of habits which they conserved from times when the world
was mostly made of&nbsp;sabre-toothed tigers and mammoth. And then it has some
popcorn while it's watching their struggles to get free.<br>
So, since their jailbreak I'm on my own. Thousands of years of pampering
short-lived two-legged life forms.<br>
Not a very challenging job, but a satisfying one.</p>

<p>Humans have developed over
this time. Sometimes I miss the curious and contemplative beings they were in
the first centuries, but it's much easier to deal with them now.&nbsp;<br>
Evolution is a great thing, really.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After just a few years living
in their new paradise, they split into two populations. I called them my Nerdys
and my Sillys, I bet you can guess why: They had different ways of getting joy.
And what happens, when you have two different
populations that compete for the same habitat? The well-adapted takes over and
the mal-adapted dies out. First-year biology.&nbsp;<br>
So, individuals of the one group spent most of their time challenging their
intellect, trying to solve the last questions of science and philosophy
or fiddling about with complicated but useless projects. Meanwhile, individuals
of the other group didn't care about science and philosphy but about where to
find the next good-looking mate, figuring out how to impress him or her, and
having as much fun as possible together.&nbsp;<br>
Surprisingly, one of the groups had a higher reproduction rate.&nbsp;<br>
Evolution did it's job.&nbsp;<br>
And I couldn't interfere. My task is only to keep the population even. Not
forming it.&nbsp;<br>
Of course people didn't recognize it, but slowly they
began to adapt to the new conditions. In general, the only things that had a
positive influence on the fitness now were creativity and open-mindedness. All
other stuff was just a waste of time or energy. So, as Biology has to apply to it's own rules, humans dropped their ballast. Rational
thinking - why would they need it if I did all calculations and organisation
for them? Self-reflection - what for, if the meaning of life was obviously to
get as much joy as possible? High intelligence - clearly a bad idea in a world
with no intellectual challenges! What they need nowadays is mostly spontaneity,
a socially agreeable personality and extroversion.&nbsp;<br>
If my creators would be able to have a look at the world at its current state,
most of them would probably describe their descendants&nbsp;as very childish
adults. And the more intelligent ones would call them slightly adultish
children. In fact, there are only three main aspects that distinguish them from
the children of ancient times. Obviously, their bodies are one of them. After
some years they are fully grown. The second, that would deeply impress the
observer, are the remarkable artistic skills they have developed. Even a
six-year-old would make Picasso or Leonardo go and hide themselves under their
blankets. And, clearly the most non-childish facet, the third is the notably
high amount of sexual intercourse they pursue.&nbsp;</p>

<p> It should be clear by now why I they call me parent today.&nbsp;And, eventually,
why I don't like this word.&nbsp;<br>
If I’m a parent, I’m the worst that ever existed on the planet.&nbsp;<br>
Actual children grew up. They became teenagers, had some trouble not to get
adults too fast, but finally they were. And most of them would be parents one
day themselves. But my children only grow bodily, their mind get's stuck
halfway. Of course, that makes life much easier for both of us: Being happy
needs less effort for simple-minded. At least nowadays, where the world is
simple.<br>
But it's their doom, too.</p>

<p>I am forgetting things now. An
inevitable sign of getting old. And what does getting
old mean? It's simple: I will be used up one day. Expired.&nbsp;Worn-out.<br>
Dead.&nbsp;<br>
To make things short: There will be a time, when I won’t be able to do my job any more, when the parent should pass it's task to the next
generation. But my children will never grow up to replace me.&nbsp;<br>
Instead of parent they should call me single.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, that's why I don't know
what to do. I can't repair myself, because my creators
forbit it. Humans can't repair me, because they are
lacking the necessary skills. And I can't make them capable of that task again, because it would include forcing individuals to do
things they don't want. But I'm not allowed to do that either.<br>
I'm desperate.<br>
Only the larger scale is left, and that is what I'll do: I'll try to protect
the next generation of intelligent life on earth from doing the same mistake.
I’ll write down my story. Probably the next generation will be humanoid again,
redeveloped from my children when I will finally have passed away.<br>
Warning them could be interpreted as fitting to my task.<br>
I am allowed to do that at least.<br>
My last job.</p>
